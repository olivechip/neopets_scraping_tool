# Neopets Image Scraper

Disclaimer:

I developed this web scraping tool that efficiently downloads Neopets images. The tool itself is my original work, and I hold the copyright to the code. This tool scrapes SunnyNeo, a Neopets fansite, for image URLs and downloads the images from Neopets. 

This tool is intended for educational and personal use only. The images downloaded using this tool are the property of Neopets and are subject to their terms of service. I do not claim any ownership or copyright over the downloaded images. Please use this tool responsibly and ethically, respecting Neopets' terms of service and usage policies.

## How to Use

To use this tool, start by cloning the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`. Then, create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv` and activate it using `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux. Install the necessary libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run the script using `python pet_img_scraper.py`. The downloaded images will be saved in the `imgs` folder, organized into subfolders for each species.

You can customize the `species` list in the `pet_img_scraper.py` file to include or exclude specific Neopets species.

Remember to respect Neopets' terms of service and usage policies. Do not overload their servers with requests, and use this tool responsibly and ethically.
